# Flight Booker App
Flight Booker is simple booking app in which user can search for flights and book for selected flights. It is developed in Ruby on Rails from scratch.

_This project's main focus is advanced forms and it is a part of
[the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum._

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

If you want to load sample users and posts, use seeds:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
